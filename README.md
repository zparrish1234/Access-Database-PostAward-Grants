# PostAward-Grants-Access-Database
This project models a grants management system designed to track awards, budget revisions, spending, budget run downs, and deliverables. The goal is to support financial reporting, grant oversight, and grant compliance. 

# Data Model
The database includes entities such as:
- Grants / Awards
- Budget revisions
- Monthly spending
- Grant codes
- Deliverables

# Business Questions Answered
- How much has been spent per grant?
- What is the remaining balance per award?
- Which grants are overspent or underutilized?
- How do budget revisions affect available funds?
- 30 / 60 / 90 due dates for deliverables. 

# Tools Used

# What I Learned
- Designing relational schemas with primary and foreign keys
- Writing analytical SQL queries using JOIN, GROUP BY, HAVING
- Translating real-world grant rules into database logic
